# 12-HOUR-CLOCK


Created a 12-hour clock on an Artix-7 FPGA board, utilizing all seven segments. This project enhanced my FPGA knowledge by teaching me how to efficiently use FPGA resources, work with displays, design clock dividers, employ FPGA-specific languages, understand clock domain crossing, and more.
